## 🧠 Machine Learning for Churn Prediction

At the heart of this dashboard is a sophisticated **Random Forest Classifier** designed to predict customer churn. The model is trained on key behavioral features:

*   **`Recency`**: Days since a customer's last purchase.
*   **`OrderCount`**: Total number of orders placed by the customer.
*   **`TotalSpent`**: The customer's lifetime monetary value.
*   **`AvgOrderValue`**: The average value of a customer's orders.

By leveraging these insights, the model effectively identifies customers likely to **churn (stop buying)**, empowering businesses to implement proactive retention strategies. Our model's accuracy and performance are fine-tuned for real-world business applications.

## 📊 RFM Segmentation: Understanding Your Customers

We implement the powerful **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Segmentation** technique to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior:

*   **Recency**: How recently did the customer make a purchase? (Indicates how active they are)
*   **Frequency**: How often do they purchase? (Measures loyalty and engagement)
*   **Monetary**: How much money do they spend? (Reflects their value to the business)

This segmentation is crucial for:
*   📈 Developing highly effective, tailored marketing campaigns.
*   🧩 Identifying and targeting your most valuable customers.
*   🔁 Proactively engaging at-risk segments to reduce churn and increase customer lifetime value.
