## 🧠 Machine Learning

We trained a **Random Forest Classifier** on:
- `Recency`: Days since last purchase
- `OrderCount`: Total orders by customer
- `TotalSpent`: Lifetime value
- `AvgOrderValue`: Purchase quality

The model predicts whether a customer will **churn (stop buying)** based on these behaviors.

✅ Accuracy and performance are optimized for business use cases.

## 📊 RFM Segmentation

Customers are segmented based on:
- **Recency** (last order)
- **Frequency** (number of orders)
- **Monetary** (total spent)

This helps:
- 📈 Improve marketing decisions
- 🧩 Target valuable customers
- 🔁 Reduce churn
